A GUI App in java. Works by locating the mouse, (if it's inside the app window, you can draw circles; already drawn ones start moving) and using mouse listeneres to establish size and coordinates of the balls soon to be drawn. 
The programme saves the coordinates of the collisions of various balls to a text file, and by using the second panel and window (PanelTwo, WindowTwo) reads them from the text file and draws the circles in position pointed to by the coordinates.
